> :warning: This is currently broken due to segfaults which I cannot able to figured out. Even thought if you manage to keep alive, it only takes 7-11 requests to kill your server automatically. If you able to figured out, please open pull request. This project was made as a hobby and likely for education purpose. **DO NOT USE FOR ACTUAL STABLE AND RELIABLE**

I am not sure if this project will work for other platform except for Linux.

# Usage
Clone this project, then run `nimble build` and run with `./nimo 6969`. You'll able to view your site at http://localhost:6969.<br>This could work for other apps such as `curl` and `nc`.

This little server only serves static website, similar to GitHub Pages. Unlikely to implement more than just that.

I am not sure if this project will work for other platform except for Linux.

# Usage
Clone this project, then run `nimble build` and run with `./nimo 6969`. You'll able to view your site at http://localhost:6969.<br>This could work for other apps such as `curl` and `nc`. You may improve performance and less console output with `-d:release` option
